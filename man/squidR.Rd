\description{
The function simulates a world inhabited by individuals whose phenotypes are generated by a user-defined phenotypic equation and then samples from this world according to a user-defined sampling design. If this is your first experience with SQuID, we highly recommend to start with the interactive SQuID application with graphical interface in order to learn and get more familiarized with the SQuID model and its sampling design (use the function \code{\link{squidApp}}).
}
\details{
A detailed description of the SQuID model and its sampling design is provided on the SQuID app (run SQuID app with \code{\link{squidApp}}). Reading the SQuID documentation on the SQuID app is prerequisite to use properly the SQuID R function.

The argument \code{input} is a list that contains the different input parameters to the SQuID model. All the parameters are listed below including their default value and a short description. If a parameter is not declared within the \code{input} list, the default value will be used.
